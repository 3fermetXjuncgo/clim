However, Fences is not a free software. You need to purchase a license to use it on your PC. The official price of Fences is $9.99 for a single license, or $29.99 for a group license that covers up to 5 PCs. That may not seem like a lot, but if you are on a tight budget or just want to try it out before buying, you may be looking for a way to get Fences product key free.
 
Fortunately, there are some methods that can help you get Fences product key free in 2023. In this article, we will show you how to do that legally and safely, without risking your PC security or violating the terms of service of Fences. Read on to find out more.
 
## Method 1: Use the Trial Version of Fences
 
The easiest and most legitimate way to get Fences product key free is to use the trial version of the software. Fences offers a 30-day free trial that allows you to use all the features of the software without any limitations. You can download the trial version from the official website of Fences [here](https://www.stardock.com/products/fences/download).
 
The trial version of Fences is fully functional and does not require any registration or activation. You can use it for 30 days and decide if you want to buy the full version or not. If you like the software and want to continue using it after the trial period expires, you can purchase a license from the same website and enter your product key to activate it.
 
The trial version of Fences is a great way to get Fences product key free for a limited time and test the software before buying it. However, if you want to use Fences for longer than 30 days, you will need to find another method.
 
## Method 2: Use a Giveaway or Discount Code
 
Another way to get Fences product key free is to use a giveaway or discount code that can reduce the price of the software or even make it free. Sometimes, Fences or its partners may offer giveaways or discounts for their products as part of their marketing campaigns or special events. You can find these offers on their official website, social media pages, newsletters, blogs, forums, or other online platforms.
 
For example, in 2020, Fences partnered with Humble Bundle to offer a bundle of PC utilities that included Fences and other software for only $15. That was a huge saving compared to the original price of Fences alone. You can check out the details of that offer [here](https://www.humblebundle.com/software/stardock-wayfarers-software-bundle).
 
To use a giveaway or discount code for Fences, you need to follow the instructions of the offer and enter the code when you purchase the software from the official website or another authorized seller. You will then receive your product key via email or another method. You can then use it to activate your copy of Fences and enjoy it for free or at a lower price.
 
The advantage of using a giveaway or discount code for Fences is that you can get a legitimate and legal product key that works with the latest version of the software and does not compromise your PC security or violate the terms of service of Fences. However, the drawback is that these offers are not always available and may have limited quantities or time frames. You need to be alert and quick to grab them before they expire or run out.
 
## Method 3: Use an Alternative Software
