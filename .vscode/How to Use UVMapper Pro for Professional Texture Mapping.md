## What is UVMapper Pro?
 
UVMapper Pro is a stand-alone application that works with any 3D software that can export and import OBJ files. It supports n-sided polygons, subdivision surfaces, and multiple UV sets. It also has a variety of mapping modes, such as planar, box, cylindrical, spherical, and polar, that let you project your texture onto your model in different ways. You can also use the interactive mapping environment to adjust the UVs in real time, using tools like move, scale, rotate, flip, weld, split, and relax.
 
## How to Use UVMapper Pro?
 
To use UVMapper Pro, you need to have an OBJ file of your model and a texture image that you want to apply to it. You can create these files using your favorite 3D software, such as Blender, Maya, or ZBrush. Once you have them ready, follow these steps:
 
1. Launch UVMapper Pro and open your OBJ file. You will see your model in the 3D viewport and a blank UV map in the 2D viewport.
2. Select a mapping mode from the drop-down menu at the top of the window. This will determine how your texture will be projected onto your model. For example, if you choose planar mapping, your texture will be projected from a single direction onto your model.
3. Adjust the mapping parameters using the sliders and buttons below the menu. You can change the scale, rotation, offset, and distortion of the projection. You can also use the mouse to drag the projection around in the 3D viewport.
4. Click on Apply Mapping to apply the projection to your model. You will see the UVs appear in the 2D viewport. You can also click on Preview Texture to see how your texture looks on your model.
5. If you are not satisfied with the result, you can undo the mapping and try a different mode or parameter. You can also use the tools in the toolbar to edit the UVs manually. For example, you can use the move tool to drag individual or selected UVs around in the 2D viewport.
6. When you are happy with your UV map, you can save it as a new OBJ file or export it as a bitmap image. You can also load another texture image and repeat the process for a different UV set.

## Conclusion
 
UVMapper Pro is a versatile and easy-to-use tool for creating and editing UV coordinates for 3D models.

## Advanced Tips and Tricks
 
UVMapper Pro has many more features and options that can help you create better UV maps for your models. Here are some of them:

- You can use the View menu to change the display settings of the viewports. For example, you can turn on or off the wireframe, the shading, the texture, and the seams. You can also zoom in or out, pan, and rotate the viewports using the mouse or keyboard shortcuts.
- You can use the Tools menu to access some useful functions, such as Align UVs, Relax UVs, Subdivide UVs, and Optimize UVs. These functions can help you improve the quality and efficiency of your UV map by reducing distortion, stretching, overlapping, and wasted space.
- You can use the Edit menu to perform some common operations on your UVs, such as cut, copy, paste, delete, invert, flip, and rotate. You can also use the Select menu to select UVs by various criteria, such as island, edge, angle, area, and color.
- You can use the File menu to import and export different file formats, such as BMP, JPG, PNG, TGA, TIFF, PSD, and SVG. You can also use the Preferences menu to customize some settings of UVMapper Pro, such as the interface language, the grid size, the background color, and the default mapping mode.
